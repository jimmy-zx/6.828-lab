# Homework: Hardware/Software Virtualization

From notes:

```
BT challenges
  Hard to find instruction boundaries, instructions vs data
  Translated code is a different size
    Thus code pointers are different
    Program expects to see original fn ptrs, return PCs on stack
    Translated code must map before use
    Thus every RET needs to look up in VMM state
```
