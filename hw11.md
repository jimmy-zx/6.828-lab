# Homework: xv6 log

## Creating a problem

The filesystem will try to allocate an inode and modify the directory.
By setting `log.lh.block[0] = 0`, the inode will not be created (since the log
marks the 0th block to be changed), but the directory item will be created.
Therefore, the path `/a` exists, but `ilock` will find the unallocated inode.

## Solving the problem

Since the log is still on the disk, fixing `recover_from_log()` will let the
filesystem correctly create `/a`, along with its inode. However, the kernel panics
before issuing the first system call, thus only the file creation (invoked by `sys_open()`
is done, but not the write system call. Therefore, the file `/a` has empty content.

## Streamlining Commit

The function `install_trans()` does the following:

1. For each log entry, read the log block
2. Copy the log block to the data block
3. Write the data block

If this function is invoked by `commit()`, there are two copies of the data:
one in the log block by `write_log()`, and one in the data block (in memory)
by the original write. Therefore, there is no need to read from the log block.

The data block is guaranteed to be in the buffer cache as `log_write()` marks
the block as dirty, `bget()` will not evict the data block.

Note that we still need to read from the log block if we are recovering.
